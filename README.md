## Project Rock Paper Scissors

This is my take on RPS form TOD. There are still missing features like better winner screen, not just alert,game length selector and there is surely a better, and easier way to do the functionality, but it is basically my first time playing with javascript, even though I created whole Foundry system (Mostly by looking at other systems, and using different parts of them, however modified for my needs.) Also I tried to make UI for it, so maybe my solution would be cleaner if I stuck with just the console version.

If we were to talk about the HTML and CSS, I wanted to make made day easier, and my code a bit cleaner, by using Bootstrap with which I am used to work.

 Hope you enjoy my lame RPS.
